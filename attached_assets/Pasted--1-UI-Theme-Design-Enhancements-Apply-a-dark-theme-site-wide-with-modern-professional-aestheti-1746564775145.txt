🌑 1. UI Theme & Design Enhancements
Apply a dark theme site-wide with modern, professional aesthetics.

Update the headlines and CTA buttons to match the design shown in the screenshots provided. Ensure typography, size, and button style follow that look and feel.

🌀 2. UX & Animation Improvements
Add hover animations: Important cards/sections (e.g., service cards, CTA blocks, testimonials) should pop slightly or animate on hover for interactivity.

Enable revolving animation for the testimonials section (carousel-style or fade-slide loop).

Make the main header menu sticky (fixed at the top) while scrolling, and ensure page content does not overlap with it at any scroll position.

⚙️ 3. Functionality Fixes
Featured Image URL: Make this optional in the admin panel (not a required field when adding resources or blog posts).

Fix the resource creation bug:

Resolve the validation error: {"code":"invalid_type","expected":"date","received":"string","path":["publishedAt"]}
→ Ensure the publishedAt field properly parses the input as a date, not a string.

Also fix the 503 Service Unavailable error during resource save — verify backend/API is functioning as expected.

Ensure ARIA warnings are addressed:
→ e.g., Missing 'Description' or 'aria-describedby' for {DialogContent} — provide proper accessibility attributes.

➕ 4. Content & Structural Additions
Add one more service section to the Services page:

Digital Marketing & Social Media Strategy
USP: “Performance-led marketing powered by data, automation, and AI.”

Description: “From AI-powered ad targeting to cross-platform growth strategies, we help brands increase visibility, engagement, and ROI across digital channels.”

CTA: “📈 Let’s Audit Your Digital Funnel — Free Strategy Session”

Ensure this service is also listed in any dropdown menus, homepage highlights, and industry landing page generation logic.

🎯 5. CTAs – Section-Specific
Replace generic CTAs with more strategic ones per section:

Homepage Hero: “🎯 Book a Free Tech Audit — Get an MVP Delivered, On Us”

Cloud Services Section: “🔍 Request a Free Cloud Cost Review”

AI Section: “🤖 Map AI Into Your Workflow — Free Demo”

Security Section: “🛡️ Get a Zero-Trust Readiness Snapshot”

Digital Marketing Section: “📈 Let’s Audit Your Digital Funnel”

Contact Page: “🤔 Not Ready to Book? Ask Us Anything — No Strings Attached”

Ensure each CTA is contextually matched and styled consistently.
