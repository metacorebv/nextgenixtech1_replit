Please apply all of the following refinements in one comprehensive checkpoint for the NextGenixTech website:

🌑 1. Dark Theme + Visual Enhancements
Apply a full dark theme site-wide using bold contrast and vibrant tech-inspired accent colors (e.g., violet, magenta, deep purple, electric teal).

Use the provided screenshots only as visual reference — do not copy layout or text. Match headline, button, and layout aesthetics based on design cues, not content.

After switching to dark theme, ensure all other sections (cards, headers, testimonials, CTAs) are visually adapted and accessible in the new color scheme.

🌀 2. UI Interactivity & Animations
Add smooth hover animation effects for service cards, CTA blocks, and testimonials.

Implement revolving/fading animation for the testimonials section.

Make the main header menu sticky, and ensure no page content overlaps it while scrolling.

⚙️ 3. Admin & Form Fixes
Make the Featured Image URL field optional in the admin panel.

Fix content publishing error:

Properly parse publishedAt as a valid Date instead of a string.

Resolve API issues (503/400 errors on resource creation).

Fix ARIA warning: Add missing aria-describedby for dialog content.

🧩 4. New Service Section
Add a service titled Digital Marketing & Social Media Strategy:

USP: “Performance-led marketing powered by data, automation, and AI.”

Description: “We build digital funnels that convert — with AI-powered targeting, omnichannel growth, and creative brand positioning.”

CTA: “📈 Let’s Audit Your Digital Funnel — Free Strategy Session”

Add to homepage, services page, menus, and filterable areas.

🎯 5. CTA Placement by Context
Homepage Hero: “🎯 Book a Free Tech Audit — Get an MVP Delivered, On Us”

Cloud Services: “🔍 Request a Free Cloud Cost Review”

AI Integration: “🤖 Map AI Into Your Workflow — Free Demo”

Security: “🛡️ Get a Zero-Trust Readiness Snapshot”

Marketing: “📈 Let’s Audit Your Digital Funnel”

Contact Page: “🤔 Not Ready to Book? Ask Us Anything — No Strings Attached”

📅 6. Calendly Integration (Fully Functional)
Do not just embed the widget. Fully integrate a working Calendly appointment scheduling system into the Contact or Booking page.

Use this Calendly account/email: connect.nextgenixtech@gmail.com

Integration must:

Load real-time availability

Support time zone detection

Allow event confirmation

Trigger email confirmations upon booking

📝 7. Enhanced Contact Form
Add the following mandatory fields:

Name, Email, Phone Number

Monthly Revenue (optional)

Budget Range (checkbox list like in the screenshot)

Readiness to Start (radio buttons or checkboxes)

Message box for project details

Ensure all fields are validated before submission and logged correctly.

🖼️ 8. Logo Update
Replace the current logo with a new design that:

Matches the dark theme

Feels premium and AI-driven

Uses sleek modern typography and clean iconography

Avoids generic, clip-art style visuals
