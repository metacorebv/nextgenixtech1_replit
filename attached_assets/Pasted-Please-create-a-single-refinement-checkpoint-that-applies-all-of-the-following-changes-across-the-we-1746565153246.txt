Please create a single refinement checkpoint that applies all of the following changes across the website and admin functionality:

🌑 1. Dark Theme + Visual Styling
Apply a dark theme across the website for a premium, tech-forward look.

Update headlines and CTA buttons to match the visual style shown in the screenshots. Focus on modern typography, strong contrast, and bold color accents.

🌀 2. UX & Animation Enhancements
Add hover animations on service cards, CTA blocks, and testimonials.

Implement revolving/fading animation for testimonials (auto-carousel).

Make the main header menu sticky and ensure no content overlaps with it while scrolling.

⚙️ 3. Admin Fixes & Bug Resolution
Make “Featured Image URL” optional in the content form.

Fix the resource creation error:

Correct publishedAt field input: should be parsed as a valid Date, not a string.

Resolve 400 and 503 errors from resource API.

Address aria-describedby warning in the dialog component for accessibility compliance.

➕ 4. New Service: Digital Marketing
Add the following to the Services page and all applicable menus:

Title: Digital Marketing & Social Media Strategy

USP: “Performance-led marketing powered by data, automation, and AI.”

Description: “We deliver cross-platform campaigns, AI-powered ad targeting, and ROI-focused growth strategies for scalable impact.”

📅 6. Smart Contact Form + Calendly Integration
